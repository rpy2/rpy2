Installation
============

`pip` should work out of the box:

    pip install rpy2

The package is known to compile on Linux, MacOSX, and Windows
(provided that developper tools are installed, and you are ready
figure out how by yourself).

Alternatively, there is a Docker image available to try rpy2 out
without concerns about the installation process.

To run the ipython console:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 rpy2/jupyter:latest ipython

To run jupypter notebook on port 8888:

    docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 rpy2/jupyter:latest

More information about Docker images can be found in the
`documentation <doc/overview.rst>`_.

In case you find yourself with this source without any idea
of what it takes to compile anything on your platform, try first

    python setup.py install

If this fails, consider looking for pre-compiled binaries (they are available on Linux Red Hat,
CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, etc...) or using the matching Docker container.

Note that `python setup.py develop` will appear to work, but will result in an
installation from the `rpy` directory here. The namespaces will be
incorrect, so don't do that!

Documentation
=============

Documentation is available either in the source tree (to be built),
or online (on readthedocs).

Testing
=======

`rpy2` is now relying on `pytest`, with the plugin `pytest-cov` for code coverage. To
test the package from the source tree, either to check and installation on your system
or before submitting a pull request, do:

    pytest tests/

For code coverage, do:

    pytest --cov=rpy2.rinterface_lib \
           --cov=rpy2.rinterface \
	   --cov=rpy2.ipython \
	   --cov=rpy2.robject \
	   tests

For more options, such as how to run specify tests, please refer to the `pytest`
documentation.
