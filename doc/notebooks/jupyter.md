# Data Import

We choose to use an external dataset to demonstrate how R's own data import
features can be used.

```python
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
utils = importr('utils')

dataf = utils.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/'
                       'master/notebooks/data/california_cities.csv')
```

The objects returned by R's own `read.csv()` function (note that the R function
in the R package `utils` is called `read.csv()` while the Python function is called
`read_csv()` - `rpy2` converts R symbols with dots to underscores for Python).

`rpy2` provides customization to display R objects such as data frames in HTML
in a notebook. That customization is enabled as follows:

```python
import rpy2.ipython.html
rpy2.ipython.html.init_printing()
```

```python
dataf
```

```python
dataf.colnames
```

```python
stats = importr('stats')
base = importr('base')
fit = stats.lm('elevation_m ~ latd + longd', data=dataf)
fit
```

# Graphics

R has arguably some the best static visualizations, often looking more polished
than other visualization systems and this without the need to spend much
effort on them.

## Using `ggplot2`

Among R visulization pacakges, `ggplot2` has emerged as something Python users
wished so much they had that various projects to try port it to Python
are regularly started.

However, the best way to have `ggplot2` might be to use `ggplot2` from Python.

```python
import rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2 as gp
```


R lets is function parameters be unevaluated language objects, which is fairly different
from Python's immediate evaluation. `rpy2` has a utility code to create such R language
objects from Python strings.
It can then become very easy to mix Python and R, with R like a domain-specific language
used from Python.

```python
from rpy2.robjects import rl
```

Calling `ggplot2` looks pretty much like it would in R, which allows one to use the
all available documentation and examples available for the R package. Remember that
this is not a reimplementation of ggplot2 with inevitable differences and delay
for having the latest changes: the R package itself is generating the figures.

```python
p = (gp.ggplot(dataf) +
     gp.aes(x=rl('longd'),
            y=rl('latd'),
            color=rl('population_total'),
            size=rl('area_total_km2')) +
     gp.geom_point() +
     gp.scale_color_continuous(trans='log10'))
```

Plotting the resulting R/ggplot2 object into the output cell of a notebook, is just
function call away.

```python
from rpy2.ipython.ggplot import image_png
image_png(p)
```

All features from `ggplot2` should be present. A more complex example to
get the figure we want is:

```python
from rpy2.robjects.vectors import IntVector
p = (gp.ggplot(dataf) +
     gp.aes(x=rl('longd'),
            y=rl('latd'),
            color=rl('population_total'),
            size=rl('area_total_km2')) +
     gp.geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
     # Axis definitions.
     gp.scale_x_continuous('Longitude') +
     gp.scale_y_continuous('Latitude') +
     # Custom size range.
     gp.scale_size(range=IntVector([1, 18])) +
     # Transform for pop -> color mapping
     gp.scale_color_continuous(trans='log10') +
     # Title.
     gp.ggtitle('California Cities: Area and Population') +
     # Plot theme and text size.
     gp.theme_light(base_size=16))
image_png(p)
```

## Using `ggplot2` extensions

There existing additional R packages extending `ggplot2`, and while it would be impossible
for the rpy2 to provide wrapper for all of them the wrapper for `ggplot2` is based
on class hierarchies that should make the use of such extensions really easy.

For example, to use the viridis color scale, we just need to import the corresponding R package,
and write 3 lines of Python to extend `rpy2`'s ggplot2 wrapper with a new color scale. A clas
diagram with the classes in the rpy2 wrapper for ggplot2 is available in the rpy2 documentation.

```python
viridis = importr('viridis')
class ScaleColorViridis(gp.ScaleColour):
    _constructor = viridis.scale_color_viridis
scale_color_viridis = ScaleColorViridis.new
```

That new color scale can then be used as any other scale already present in `ggplot2`:

```python
p = (gp.ggplot(dataf) +
     gp.aes(x=rl('longd'),
            y=rl('latd'),
            color=rl('population_total'),
            size=rl('area_total_km2')) +
     gp.geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
     gp.scale_x_continuous('Longitude') +
     gp.scale_y_continuous('Latitude') +
     gp.scale_size(range=IntVector([1, 18])) +
     scale_color_viridis(trans='log10') +
     gp.ggtitle('California Cities: Area and Population') +
     gp.theme_light(base_size=16))
image_png(p)
```

So far we have shown that using `ggplot2` can be done from Python as if it
was just an other Python library for visualization, but R can also be used
in cells.

First the so-called "R magic" extension should be loaded.

```python
%load_ext rpy2.ipython
```

From now on, code cells starting with `%%R` will see their content evaluated as R code.
If the R code is generating figures, they will be displayed along with the rest of the output.

```python
%%R
R.version.string
```


```python
%%R -i dataf

require(dplyr)
glimpse(dataf)
```

The data frame called `dataf` in our Python notebook was already bound to the name
`dataf` in the R main namespace (`GlobalEnv` in the R lingo) in our previous cell.
We can just use it in subsequent cells.

```python
%%R -w 800 --type=cairo

cat("Running an R code cell.\n")

p <- ggplot(dataf) +
     aes(x=longd,
         y=latd,
         color=population_total,
         size=area_total_km2) +
     geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
     scale_x_continuous('Longitude') +
     scale_y_continuous('Latitude') +
     scale_size(range=c(1, 18)) +
     scale_color_viridis(trans='log10') +
     ggtitle('California Cities: Area and Population') +
     theme_light(base_size=16)
print(p)
```
