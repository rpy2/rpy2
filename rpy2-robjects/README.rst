rpy2-robjects
=============

About
-----

The `rpy2` package is a namespace package. This is the part of
that package that covers the "high-level" interface to R used in
`rpy2`. It uses the "low-level" interface (bindings to R's
C API) to create a more Pythonic and safer interface in
`rpy2.robjects` as well as extentions for ipython and jupyter
notebooks in `rpy2.ipython`. 

Installation
------------

To install this package from a Python package repository, just enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install rpy2-robjects

or

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install rpy2
