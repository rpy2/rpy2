Release 2.3.0
=============

New Features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- C-level API, allowing other C-level modules to make use of utilities
  without going through the Python level. The exact definition of
  the API is not yet fixed. For now there is 
  PyRinteractive_IsInitialized() to assess whether R was initialized
  (through :mod:`rpy2.rinterface` or not).

- C-module _rpy_device, allowing one to implement R graphical devices
  in Python [(very) experimental]

- Tracking of R objects kept protected from garbage collection by rpy2
  is now possible.

- New method :meth:`Sexp.rid` to return the identifier of the R object
  represented by a Python/rpy2 object

:mod:`rpy2.rinteractive`:

- Dynamic build of Python docstrings out of the R manual pages

:mod:`rpy2.robjects.help`:

- Build dynamic help

:mod:`rpy2.robjects.packages:

- Build anonymous R packages from strings

- When using :func:`importr`, the datasets are added as an attribute
  :attr:`data`, itself an instance of a new class :class:`PackageData`.
  It no longer possible to access datasets are regular objects from
  a code package (because of changes in R), and the new system is
  more robust against quirks.

Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :attr:`SexpClosure.env` to replace the method `closureenv`.


Release 2.2.6
=============

Bugs fixed

  in :mod:`rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2`


Release 2.2.5
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Memory leak when creating R vectors from Python (issue #82)

Release 2.2.3
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Dynamic construction of S4 classes was looking for R help as 'class.<class>'
  rather than '<class>-class'

- The cleanup of temporary directories created by R was not happening if
  the Python process terminated without calline :func:`rpy2.rinterface.endr()`
  (issue #68, and proof-of-principle fix by chrish42)

=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- With the robjects layer, repr() on a list containing non-vector elements
  was failing

Release 2.2.1

Release 2.2.0
=============

New Features
------------

- Support for Python 3, and for some of its features ported to Python 2.7

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :meth:`Environment.keys` to list the keys

- classes :class:`robjects.vectors.POSIXlt` and 
  :class:`robjects.vectors.POSIXlt` to represent vectors of R

  automatically R S4 classes as Python classes.

- :meth:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.FactorVector.iter_labels` to iterate over the labels

- :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.ListVector` to represent R lists.

- Constructor for :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.ListVector` and 
  :class:`rpy2.robjects.vectors.DataFrame` accept any iterable at the condition
  that the elements iterated through also valid subscripts for it (e.g., given
  an iterable v, the following is valid:

  .. code-block:: python

     x[k] for x in v


:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :func:`rpy2.rinterface.rternalise` to wrap Python function as :class:`SexpClosure` that can
  be called by R just as it was a function of its own.

- :class:`rpy2.rinterface.RNULLType` for R's C-level NULL value and 
  :class:`rpy2.rinterface.UnboundValueType` for R's C-level R_UnboundValue
  (both singletons).

- :meth:`rinterface.SexpVector.index`, of similar behaviour to :meth:`list.index`.

- :meth:`rpy2.rinterface.Sexp.list_attrs` to list the names of all R attributes
  for a given object.

- :class:`rpy2.rinterface.ByteSexpVector` to represent R 'raw' vectors.

- constant `R_LEN_T_MAX` to store what is the maximum length for a vector in R.

:mod:`rpy2.rlike`:

- :class:`container.OrdDict` get proper methods :meth:`keys` and `get`

:mod:`rpy2.interactive`:

- A new sub-package to provide utilities for interactive work, either for
  handling R interactive events or use Python for interactive programming
  (as often done with the R console)

Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- NA_bool, NA_real, NA_integer, NA_character and NA_complex are now
  deprecated (and removed).
  NA_Logical, NA_Real, NA_Integer, NA_Character, NA_Complex should be used.

- classes representing R vector also inherit their type-specific
  rinterface-level counterpart.

- Importing the :class:`rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri` is no longer sufficient
  to active the conversion. Explicit activation is now needed; the function
  `activate` can do that.


:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :class:`IntSexpVector`, :class:`FloatSexpVector`,
  :class:`StrSexpVector`, :class:`BoolSexpVector`, :class:`ComplexSexpVector`

- Methods :meth:`slotnames`, :meth:`isclass`, and :meth:`validobject`
  for :class:`RS4`

- Vector-like objects now in a module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.vectors`

- :func:`set_accessors` for adding simply accessors to a class inheriting
  from :class:`RS4`

- :class:`RS4_Type` for metaclass-declared accessors

- Delegating classes :class:`ExtractDelegator` and 
  :class:`DoubleExtractDelegator` for extracting the R-way

- :class:`DataFrame` (formerly *RDataFrame*) can now be created 
  from :`rlike.container.OrdDict`
  instances, or any other object inheriting from dict.

- :class:`FactorVector` to represent R factors

- the conversion is now returning subclasses of
  :class:`robjects.vectors.Vector` -formerly *RVector*-
  (such as :class:`IntVector`, 
  :class:`FloatVector`, etc...) rather than only return :class:`Vector`

- :class:`StrVector` has a method :meth:`factor` to turn a
  vector of strings into an R factor

- Initial commit of a callback-based implementation of an R graphical device
  (this is for the moment very experimental - and not fully working)

- :meth:`SexpClosure.rcall` is now taking 2 parameters, 
  a tuple with the parameters and
  an :class:`SexpEnvironment` in which the call is to be evaluated.

  :class:`double`, :class:`bool`, and :class:`None` 
  in a call (using :class:`SexpClosure`) are now automatically converted
  to length-one R vectors (at the exception of None, converted
  to R_NilValue).

- Python slices can now be used on R vector-like objects

  and :class:`TaggedList`

- static method :meth:`from_iteritems` for :class:`TaggedList`,
  for creating a TaggedList from any object having a method :meth:`iteritems`


Changes

  R library-related paths are wished. python setup.py --help build_ext will
  list them
  
:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- RS4 no longer makes R's slots as Python attributes through :meth:`__attr__`

- The package is split into modules

- The broken variables NA_STRING, NA_INTEGER, NA_LOGICAL, and NA_REAL are
  removed. The documentation on missing values was revised.

- :data:`globalEnv` and :data:`baseNameSpaceEnv` were renamed to 
  :data:`globalenv` and :data:`baseenv` respectively

- The parameter *wantFun* in :meth:`Environment.get` 
  (formerly *REnvironment.get()*) is now *wantfun* 

- :attr:`Vector.r` does not have a __getitem__ method any longer
  (see in `.rx` and `.rx2` in the new features)

  for :class:`DataFrame` are now property-style getters

- :meth:`nrow`, :meth:`ncol` for :class:`Array` 
  are now property-style getters

- static method :meth:`from_csvfile` and 
  instance method :meth:`to_csvfile` for :class:`DataFrame`

- module :mod:`lib` to store modules representing R packages

- module :mod:`lib.ggplot2` for the CRAN package ggplot2.

- renaming of few classes, the *R* prefix: :class:`Formula` (from *RFormula*),
  :class:`DataFrame` (from *RDataFrame*), :class:`Array` (from *RArray*),
  :class:`Matrix` (from *RMatrix*), :class:`Environment` (from *REnvironment*),
  :class:`Function` (from *RFunction*), :class:`Vector` (from *RVector*).

- :class:`robjects.vectors.Vector` lost the (now redundant) methods
  `subset` and `assign`. Those operations were just aliases to the 
  :class:`ExtractDelegator`

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :data:`globalEnv`, :data:`baseNameSpaceEnv`, and :data:`emptyEnv` 
  were renamed to :data:`globalenv`, :data:`baseenv` and :data:`emptyenv`

  and a setter)

:mod:`rpy2.rpy_classic`:

- R named lists are returned as Python :class:`dict`, like rpy-1.x does it, with the
  notable difference that duplicate names are not silently overwritten: an exception
  of class :class:`ValueError` is thrown whenever happening


Bugs fixed
----------

- :meth:`REnvironment.get` now accepts a named parameter *wantFun*
  (like :meth:`rinterface.SexpEnvironment` does)

- :class:`rinterface.SexpVector` will now properly raise an exception
  when trying to create vector-like object of impossible type

- Crash when trying to create a SexpVector of a non-vector type

- R objects of class *matrix* are now properly converted into :class:`RMatrix`
  (instead of :class:`Array`)

Release 2.0.7
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- On win32, printing an object was leaving an open file handle behind each time,
  leading to an error and the impossibility to print
  (# bug report and fix by Christopher Gutierrez)

=============

No user-visible change. Win32-specific additions to the C module
were made to compile it.

----------

- Added missing named parameter *wantfun* to method :meth:`REnvironment.get`
  (making it similar to :meth:`SexpEnvironment.get`)

- Leak in reference counting when creating SexpVector objects fixed
  (the symptom was a process growing in size when creating R vector from
  Python list or numpy arrays)

- `R CMD config LAPACK_LIBS` could return an empty string when R was compiled
  with the veclib framework, causing the setup.py script to raise an exception.
  setup.py now only print a message about an empty string returned from 
  R CMD config

- Numpy arrays with complex elements are no longer causing segfaults

- Calls to :meth:`SexpClosure.rcall` with something else that the expected
  kind of tuple could cause a segfault


Release 2.0.3
=============

New Features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- :meth:`process_revents`, a Wrapper for R_ProcessEvents 
  (# suggested by June Kim to help with issues related to interactive display on win32),
  and for R_RunHandlers on UNIX-like systems 
  (# patch by Nathaniel Smith).

  (# Patch by Nathaniel Smith) 

- :meth:`Sexp.__deepcopy__` to copy an object (calling Rf_Duplicate) 
   (# from a patch by Nathaniel Smith)
 
Changes
-------

- :meth:`Sexp.do_slot_assign` now creates the slot if missing
  (design-fix - # patch by Nathaniel Smith)
 

Bugs fixed
----------
 
- fixed problem of numpy interface with R boolean vectors. 
  They are now presented as 'i' rather than 'b' to numpy
  (# patch submitted by Nathaniel Smith)
 
- The mechanism for setting arbitrary callaback functions for console I/O 
  now ensures that a traceback is printed to stderr whenever an error
  occurs during the evalutation of the callback (the raised exception used
  to be silently propagated to the next python call, leading to problems).



Release 2.0.2
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Fix installation bug when the include directories contain either '-' or 'I'
  #spotted by James Yoo

- Failing to initialize R now throws a RuntimeError

- R objects of type EXPRSXP are now handled as vectors (... but this may change again)

- :func:`initEmbeddedR` renamed to :func:`initr`

- :func:`endEmbeddedR` renamed to :func:`endr`


:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :class:`R` remains a singleton, but does not throw an exception when multiple instances are requested


Bugs fixed
----------

- unable to compile on Python2.4 (definition of aliases to Python2.5-specific were not where they should be).

- overflow issues on Python 2.4/64 bits when indexing R vector with very large integers.

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- method :meth:`named`, corresponding to R's C-level NAMED

- experimental methods :meth:`frame` and :meth:`enclos` for SexpEnvironment corresponding to R's C-level FRAME and ENCLOS

- method :meth:`rcall` for :class:`ClosureSexp`

- new experimental class :class:`SexpLang` for R language objects.


Bugs fixed
----------

- R stack checking is disabled (no longer crashes when multithreading)

- fixed missing R_PreserveObject for vectors (causing R part of the object to sometimes vanish during garbage collection)

- prevents calling an R function when R has been ended (raise :class:`RuntimeException`).


Release 2.0.0a1
===============

New features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- method :meth:`getnames` for :class:`RVector`

- experimental methods :meth:`__setitem__` and :meth:`setnames` for :class:`RVector`

- method 'getnames' for :class:`RArray`

- new class :class:`RFormula`

- new helper class :class:`RVectorDelegator` (see below)

- indexing RVector the "R way" with subset is now possible through a delegating attribute (e.g., myvec.r[True] rather than myvec.subset(True)). #suggested by Michael Sorich

- new class :class:`RDataFrame`. The constructor :meth:`__init__` is still experimental (need for an ordered dictionnary, that will be in before the beta

- filled documentation about mapping between objects

Changes
-------

- many fixes and additions to the documentation

- improved GTK console in the demos

- changed the major version number to 2 in order to avoid confusion with rpy 1.x # Suggested by Peter and Gregory Warnes

- moved test.py to demos/example01.py

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- changed method name `getNames` to `getnames` where available (all lower-case names for methods seems to be the accepted norm in Python).


Bugs fixed
----------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- fixed string representation of R object on Microsoft Windows (using fifo, not available on win32)

- :meth:`__getattr__` for :class:`RS4` is now using :meth:`ri2py` 

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- fixed context of evaluation for R functions (now R_GlobalEnv)

Release 1.0a0
=============

- first public release
