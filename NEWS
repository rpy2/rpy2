Release 2.0.8 (under development)
=================================

Bugs fixed
----------

- The conversion of long ints from python to R in robjects was missing
  (# bug report and fix by Yair)


Release 2.0.7
=============


Bugs fixed
----------

- On win32, printing an object was leaving an open file handle behind each time,
  leading to an error and the impossibility to print
  (# bug report and fix by Christopher Gutierrez)

- :mod:`rpy_classic` threw errors about an unknown 'getSexp' when trying to extract
  elements from an object

- :mod:`rpy_classic` had issues when switching between the CONVERSION/NO_CONVERSION
   modes


Release 2.0.6
=============

No user-visible change. Win32-specific additions to the C module
were made to compile it.


Release 2.0.5
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Build with -framework used (OS X) will/should work properly

- Crash when calling :meth:`SexpEnvironment.get` with an empty string
  #bug report by Walter Moreira

- Crash when calling :meth:`SexpEnvironment.__getitem__` with an empty
  string


Release 2.0.4
=============

Bugs fixed
----------

- Added missing named parameter *wantfun* to method :meth:`Renvironment.get`
  (making it similar to :meth:`SexpEnvironment.get`)

- Leak in reference counting when creating SexpVector objects fixed
  (the symptom was a process growing in size when creating R vector from
  Python list or numpy arrays)

- `R CMD config LAPACK_LIBS` could return an empty string when R was compiled
  with the veclib framework, causing the setup.py script to raise an exception.
  setup.py now only print a message about an empty string returned from 
  R CMD config

- Numpy arrays with complex elements are now longer causing segfaults


Release 2.0.3
=============

New features
------------

- All callbacks are getting a get<callback> to complement the set<callback>.
  (# patch submitted by Nathaniel Smith) 

- :meth:`process_revents`, a wrapper for R_ProcessEvents 
  (# suggested by June Kim to help with issues related to interactive display on win32), 
  and for R_RunHandlers on UNIX-like systems 
  (# patch by Nathaniel Smith).

- :meth:`Sexp.__deepcopy__` to copy an object (calling Rf_Duplicate) 
  (# from a patch by Nathaniel Smith)

Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- the default for reading and writing the console are now using sys.stdin and sys.stdout 
  (# patch submitted by Nathaniel Smith)

- console IO callbacks (reading and writing) are complemented by 
  one to flush the console
  (# backport from 2.1-dev) 

- :meth:`Sexp.do_slot_assign` now creates the slot if missing
  (design-fix - # patch by Nathaniel Smith)

Bugs fixed
----------

- fixed problem with numpy interface with R boolean vectors. 
  They are now presented as 'i' rather than 'b' to numpy
  (# patch submitted by Nathaniel Smith)

- The mechanism for setting arbitrary callaback functions for console I/O 
  now ensures that a traceback is printed to stderr whenever an error
  occurs during the evalutation of the callback (the raised exception used
  to be silently propagated to the next python call, leading to problems).


Release 2.0.2
=============

Known problems
--------------

- Numpy arrays with complex or unicode elements seem to be now causing a
  segfault

Bugs fixed
----------

- Fix installation bug when the include directories contain either '-' or 'I'
  #spotted by James Yoo

- Failing to initialize R now throws a RuntimeError

- Copying an R "NA" into Python returns a None (and no longer a True)
  (#fixes a bug reported by Jeff Gentry)


Release 2.0.1
=============

New features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- Property `names` for the :class:`RVector` methods :meth:`getnames` 
  and :meth:`setnames` (this was likely forgotten for Release 2.0.0).

- Property `rclass` for :class:`RObjectMixin` 

Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :meth:`rclass` becomes :meth:`getrclass`

Bugs fixed
----------

- Having the environment variable R_HOME specified resulted in an error
  when importing :mod:`rpy2.rinterface` # root of the problem spotted by Peter

- Setup.py has no longer a (possibly outdated) static hardcoded version number
  for rpy2

- Testing no longer stops with an error in the absence of the third-party
  module :mod:`numpy`

- :meth:`rpy2.rlike.container.TaggedList.pop` is now returning the element
  matching the given index



Release 2.0.0
=============

New features
------------

- New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.conversion`.

- New module :mod:`rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri` to convert :mod:`numpy` objects
  into :mod:`rpy2` objects. 
  # adapted from a patch contributed by Nathaniel Smith


Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.rpy_classic`:

- :meth:`rpy_classic.RObj.getSexp` moved to a 
  property :attr:`rpy_classic.Robj.sexp`.

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :meth:`RObject.__repr__` moved to :meth:`RObject.r_repr`

- :meth:`ri2py`, :meth:`ro2py`, and :meth:`py2ri` moved to the new module
  :mod:`conversion`. Adding the prefix `conversion.` to calls
  to those functions will be enough to update existing code


Bugs fixed
----------

- Informative message returned as RuntimeError when failing to find R's HOME

- Use the registry to find the R's HOME on win32
  # snatched from Peter's earlier contribution to rpy-1.x


Release 2.0.0rc1
================


New features
------------

- added :data:`__version__` to rpy2/__init__.py

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- added classes :class:`StrVector`, :class:`IntVector`, :class:`FloatVector`, :class:`BoolVector`

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- added missing class :class:`BoolSexpVector`.


Changes
-------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- does not alias :class:`rinterface.StrSexpVector`, :class:`rinterface.IntSexpVector`, :class:`rinterface.FloatSexpVector` anymore

- Constructor for :class:`rpy2.robjects.RDataFrame` checks that R lists are data.frames (not all lists are data.frame)

- Formerly new attribute :attr:`_dotter` for :class:`R` is now gone. The documentaion now points to :mod:`rpy2.rpy_classic` for this sort of things.

Bugs fixed
----------

- conditional typedef in rinterface.c to compile under win32 # reported and initial proposed fix from Paul Harrington

- __pow__ was missing from the delegator object for robjects.RVector (while the documentation was claiming it was there) # bug report by Robert Nuske

- Earlier change from Sexp.typeof() to getter Sexp.typeof was not reflected in :mod:`rpy2.rpy_classic` # bug report by Robert Denham

- the method :meth:`Sexp.typeof` was replaced by a Python `getter` :attr:`typeof`.

- the method :meth:`Sexp.named` was replaced by a Python `getter` :attr:`named`.

- R objects of type LANGSXP are now one kind of vector (... but this may change again)

- R objects of type EXPRSXP are now handled as vectors (... but this may change again)

- :func:`initEmbeddedR` renamed to :func:`initr`

- :func:`endEmbeddedR` renamed to :func:`endr`


:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- :class:`R` remains a singleton, but does not throw an exception when multiple instances are requested


Bugs fixed
----------

- unable to compile on Python2.4 (definition of aliases to Python2.5-specific were not where they should be).

- overflow issues on Python 2.4/64 bits when indexing R vector with very large integers.

- handling of negative indexes for :class:`SexpVector`'s :meth:`__getitem__` and :meth:`__setitem__` was missing

- trying to create an instance of :class:`SexpVector` before initializing R raises a RuntimeException (used to segfault)

- experimental method :meth:`enclos` was not properly exported

- setup.py was exiting prematurely when R was compiled against an existing BLAS library

Bugs fixed
----------

- R stack checking is disabled (no longer crashes when multithreading)

- indexing RVector the "R way" with subset is now possible through a delegating attribute (e.g., myvec.r[True] rather than myvec.subset(True)). #suggested by Michael Sorich

- new class :class:`RDataFrame`. The constructor :meth:`__init__` is still experimental (need for an ordered dictionnary, that will be in before the beta

- filled documentation about mapping between objects

Changes
-------

- many fixes and additions to the documentation
